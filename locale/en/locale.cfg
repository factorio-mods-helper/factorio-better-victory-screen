bvs-enable-show-victory-screen-command=Enable the command [color=cyan]/show-victory-screen[/color] that shows the victory screen as if victory has been reached, without actually triggering the victory. This is mainly for development purposes, but might be interesting for some players. This command does not have any impact on the game.
