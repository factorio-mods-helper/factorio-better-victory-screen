A better victory screen that places the focus on automation, and not combat. Can safely be added to an existing save.

If enabled in settings you can view the victory screen at any time by typing the command `/show-victory-screen`. This is disabled by default.

# Compatibility

All mods should be automatically compatible. Please let me know if you find a mod that isn't.

Additionally, any mod can also add custom statistics to the GUI, or remove existing entries. [More information...](https://github.com/heinwessels/factorio-better-victory-screen/blob/main/mod-page/compatibility.md)

# Caveats:
- One or two statistics (like "distance walked") will only be accurate if mod is added at the start of a save file.
- Finish button is not functional due to modding API limitations.
- Some shown statistics are only estimates, for example the total pipeline length.
