### Caveats:
- Some statistics (like "distance walked") will only be accurate if mod is added at the start of a save file.
- Overhaul mods that change the vanilla victory condition is not supported.
- Finish button is not functional due to modding API limitations.
- Technically the game engine will never be notified that the game actually completes, and which might prevent some achievements.
